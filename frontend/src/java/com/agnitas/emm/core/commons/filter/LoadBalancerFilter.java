/**
 * Filter that prevents session being created on disabled node.
 * 
 * This filter is required, because some users forces login to disabled node
 * by using bookmarked URLs, reusing timed-out sessions, ...
 * 
 * How this filter works:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>
 *   	The filter checks, if the request attribute <i>{@value #LOAD_BALANCER_ACTIVATION_ATTRIBUTE}</i> is present.
 *      If not, processing the request is continued with next filter in chain.
 *   </li>
 * 	 <li>
 * 		If request attribute is present, the activation state of current node is checked. If node is not disabled, processing
 * 		the request is continued with next filter in chain. (Note: The state <i>stopped</i> is not checked, because a stopped
 * 		does not process any requests.)
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *   	If current node is disabled, the validity of the given session ID is checked. If session is valid, processing the request
 *   	is continued with next filter in chain. (Note: With proceeding time all session will expire, either by logout by user or by
 *   	exceeding the maximum idle time of the session.)
 *   </li>
 *   <li>
 *     If current session is invalid, the filter sends a redirect to the load balancer. In this case, the user will see the front page
 *     (in most cases some login page) of the active node.
 *   </li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 *   <b>Note:</b> This filter works with mod_jk only. Version 1.2.32 or newer of mod_jk is required. Older versions do not provide the
 *   required request attribute.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   <b>Note:</b> Newer versions of mod_jk (current is 1.2.37) have a that randomly enables and disables nodes.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 *   There are three different activation states:
 *   <ul>
 *     <li></i>active</i>: The node is active and will receive any request (with valid and invalid session IDs). This is the normal running state of a node.</li>
 *     <li></i>disabled</i>: The node is active but will receive only request with session IDs pointing to that node. This is the state to shutdown the node in future.</li>
 *     <li></i>stopped</i>: The node is inactive and will not receive any request.</li>
 *   </ul>
 * 
 *   (See documentation of mod_jk for better descriptions.)
 * </p>
