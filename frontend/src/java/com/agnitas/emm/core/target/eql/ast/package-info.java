/**
 * This package contains classes representing nodes in the syntax tree.
 *
 * The nodes can be considered as instructions of a virtual machine. The syntax tree
 * will be used by the code generators when generating code for the target language.
 * 
 * The syntax tree can be broken into three levels:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><i>boolean level</i>: This is the top-most level and contains the boolean operators like AND.</li>
 *   <li><i>relational level</i>: In this level, relational operator (like &lt;) can be found. It acts as a bridge between boolean and arithmetic expressions.</li>
 *   <li><i>arithmetic (expressional) level</i>: In this level, arithmetic expressions (like +, -) are located.</li>
 *   <li><i>atomic level</i>: Here are constants, names, strings, etc. located.</li>
 * </ol>
