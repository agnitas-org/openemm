 * Quotas.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * This package provides services for quotas to access different types of APIs.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 *   To check access, a username, a company ID and the name of the requested API service
 *   is needed. For webservice, the API service name is the name of the endpoint.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <h3>Basic usage</h3>
 * <p>
 *   The interface {@link com.agnitas.emm.util.quota.api.QuotaService} provides a single
 *   method {@link com.agnitas.emm.util.quota.api.QuotaService#checkAndTrack(String, int, String)},
 *   which checks, logs and possibly rejects the access.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 *   Simply invoke this method.
