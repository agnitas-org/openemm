/**
 * This is the public API that is used when one wants to implement a new startup job.
 * 
 * A startup job must implement the interface {@link com.agnitas.startuplistener.api.StartupJob}. 
 * 
 * Errors must be signaled by a {@link com.agnitas.startuplistener.api.StartupJobException}. This exception does the following:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The job is marked as <i>failed</i> in the job list</li>
 *   <li>The job does not abort the execution of the job list. Execution will continue with the subsequent job.</li>
 * </ul>
