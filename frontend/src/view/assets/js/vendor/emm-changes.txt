1) jquery-select2-3.5.2.js
- added option-related tooltip support: selected option's title attribute (if available) or value (text) is assigned to input's title attribute on selection event.
- restored clickability within selected entries.
- enabled re-triggering of killed events (e.g. mouseup and mousedown) but with ".sortable" suffix (to restore "sortable" widget functionality within select2 results).
- added hierarchy mode support (when 'js-tree-select' class assigned), provided proper highlighting and selection for sub and super-items.
- made document.body as Element prototype to prevent wkhtmltopdf errors

2) ace/worker-html.js
- removed error emit for 'almost-standards-doctype'.

3) bootstrap-tooltip-3.2.0.js
- changed an order of statements to make sure that placement function is able to get an actual balloon's dimensions
- changed tooltip validation function to indicate that triggering element is detached (former implementation was suitable for a special case only - when there's no immediate parent node)

4) query-builder.js
- added localization for builder.

5) c3.js
- added fix in method c3_chart_internal_fn.getYDomain(...). c3 sets wrong padding in rotated charts.
- fixed tick culling algorithm to prevent titles cutting and provide more uniform titles distribution.

6) toastr.custom.js
- deeply customized before initial commit
- replaced 'notification-top-right' with 'notification-below-header' container style in order to provide custom positioning

7) bootstrap-modal-3.2.0.js
- added a click event handler to a backdrop so a click outside a <div class="modal"></div> also hides a dialog.

8) ace.js
- introduced custom implementation of trim method which does not rely on regular expressions.

9) query-builder.js
- update QB version from 2.3.2 to 2.5.2
- added localization according to changes made in previous version

- updated QB styles version from 2.3.2 to 2.5.2
