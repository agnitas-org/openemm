Basic badges are tiny objects usually only used to display a text.
They are however very flexible.

An important condition is that the background color must be set for the badge.
You can see the list of Bootstrap classes for setting the background [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/helpers/color-background/).

```htmlexample
<span class="badge badge--standard-blue">Primary</span>
```

Badges can also contain text and icons in any order and multitude.
Text inside has to be wrapped inside `<span>`.

```htmlexample
<span class="badge badge--dark-red">
  <i class="icon icon-angle-left"></i>
  <span>Danger</span>
  <i class="icon icon-angle-right"></i>
</span>
```

You can also use more large version of the badge just using class `.badge--lg`.

```htmlexample
<span class="badge badge--lg badge--standard-blue">Primary</span>
```

The square badge can have any color you want. To do this you need to use a class `.square-badge` and give it some kind of background color.

```htmlexample
<span class="square-badge badge--standard-blue"></span>
<span class="square-badge badge--dark-red"></span>
<span class="square-badge" style="background: orange"></span>
```
