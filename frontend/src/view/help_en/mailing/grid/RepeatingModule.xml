    <content><![CDATA[With the Repeating Module option you can create blocks that are automatically inserted several times in the mailing.
    If you activate this switch, in the first step you select the reference table in which the contents for the module are to be found. 
    With Filter you limit the selection of contents, e.g. a certain category or values. The syntax for the filter is <i>$table.column == 'value'</i>. <br />
    The name of the reference table must be prefixed with a $ character. The name of the column that must have the value follows separated by a dot.
    The operator is followed by two is-equal characters and then a value (string in apostrophes), e.g. <i>$article.productid == '123456'</i>.
    <br /><br />
    As a rule, the modules are inserted into the mailing in ascending order of the ID column of your reference table. If you would like a different sorting, simply contact us.
    <br /><br />
    <b>Note:</b> The function Repeating Module requires the Retargeting Package and can be activated on request. Please contact your account manager.]]>
