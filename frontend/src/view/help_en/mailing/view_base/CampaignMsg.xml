	<content><![CDATA[By selecting a Archive, you assign the mailing to a specific archive. This makes mailing updates
easier if you have to manage a large number of mailings. Moreover, it gives you another option
for statistical evaluation. All previously defined archives are displayed in that drop-down list.
Further information on archives and how to create them is contained in Chapter Archives - Grouping Mailings. You do not
have to assign the mailing to a archive. The mailing will also work as a stand-alone action. You
can always select an archive or change the archive assignment for your mailing later.]]></content>
