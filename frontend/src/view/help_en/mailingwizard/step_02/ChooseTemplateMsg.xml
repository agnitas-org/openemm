	<content><![CDATA[What is a template? Most mailings and regular newsletters in particular always have the same structure. There are sub-headings, delimiters, closing remarks, contact details, links for unsubscribing etc. If you were to create all these components all over again for each new mailing, this will mean duplicate work, lost time and renewed error sources. The E-Marketing Manager helps you to reduce work to a minimum. Templates are the whole secret. You define a framework and only add up-to-date content to your mailing.]]></content>
