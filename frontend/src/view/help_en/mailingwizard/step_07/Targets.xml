The </SPAN><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Target

various options for narrowing down your list of mailing recipients
further. In order to be able to work with target groups, you have to
define your target groups. Further information can be found in
chapter 5. The default setting is „no target groups“. In order to
limit the mailing to a certain target group, select the required
target group from the drop-down list and click on the </SPAN><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Add</SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">
button. Now, the E-Marketing Manager will show that target group
above the relevant drop-down list. Using the </SPAN><FONT FACE="Tahoma, sans-serif"><SPAN LANG="en-US">Delete
</SPAN></FONT><SPAN LANG="en-GB">symbol behind the selection will
remove the selected target group. It is also possible to combine
various target groups.</SPAN></P>]]></content>
