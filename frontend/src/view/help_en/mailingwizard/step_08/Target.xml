	<title>Target group</title>
	<content><![CDATA[It does not always makes sense to send a mailing to all recipients on a mailing list. The Target groups functional area contains various options for narrowing down your list of mailing recipients further. In order to be able to work with target groups, you have to define your target groups. Further information can be found in chapter 5. The default setting is "no target groups". In order to limit the mailing to a certain target group, select the required target group from the drop-down list and click on the Add button. Now, the E-Marketing Manager will show that target group above the relevant drop-down list. Using the Delete symbol behind the selection will remove the selected target group. It is also possible to combine various target groups.]]></content>
