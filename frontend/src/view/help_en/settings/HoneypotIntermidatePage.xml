    <content><![CDATA[This indicator informs you whether the EMM bot intermediate page to protect against automated link clicks is active or not.
To avoid multiple clicks by automated bots in the mailing, you have the option of an integrated intermediate page in the EMM. If a link click is generated by a potential bot, the EMM automatically switches to an intermediate page and directs the bot to it. To reach the actual link destination, another click must be made on this page. This redirection does not take place for a regular recipient, who is taken directly to the link destination.
This is intended to prevent bots from triggering link clicks and their actions and, for example, falsifying statistics in the EMM.]]></content>
